# Logistic Regression & Gaussian Naive Bayes

In this homework assignment there are two tasks two achieve; first task is to choose a dataset provided by
UCI ML Repository and implement Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes for this dataset to make
comparison between these methods, following this, second task is to implement regularization for Logistic
regression and make comparison between Logistic Regression model with and without parameter regularization
on the same dataset.
